# Quartz-Swagger-3
## Overview
Welcome to the Quartz Dynamic Scheduler project! This repository provides a powerful Spring Boot application that integrates key functionalities using several modern technologies, notably Quartz, Springdoc Swagger 3, and Liquibase for database management.

## Features
Quartz Scheduler
The core of this application is built around Quartz, a robust and advanced job scheduling library that is integral for managing and executing scheduled tasks within your Spring Boot application. With support for both simple and complex job scheduling, developers can easily set up cron jobs or repeatable schedules, ensuring that background tasks are performed with precision and reliability.

## Swagger 3 Integration
Leveraging Swagger 3 (via Springdoc), this project offers a seamless way to document your RESTful APIs. The generated documentation is user-friendly, providing both developers and stakeholders with visual insights into endpoints, models, and request/response structures. This enhances collaboration and speeds up the development process by ensuring clear communication of API capabilities.

## Liquibase for Database Management
Database versioning and migration have never been easier with Liquibase. This project utilizes Liquibase for managing database schema changes and migrations in a controlled and reliable manner. Utilizing an XML-based changelog allows for an easy overview of database changes, making it simpler to track changes, collaborate with your team, and deploy updates with confidence.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following key dependencies:

1. Quartz: For scheduling and executing tasks reliably.
2. Liquibase: For managing database migrations and version control.
3. Swagger 3 (Springdoc): For creating interactive API documentation.
4. MySQL Connector: To connect your Spring Boot application with MySQL databases.
5. Lombok: A Java library that aims to reduce boilerplate code, enhancing code clarity.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Quartz Dynamic Scheduler project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Java 21**: Ensure you have JDK 21 installed on your machine.
2. **Maven**: Make sure Apache Maven is installed for building the project and managing dependencies.
3. **Database**: Set up a MySQL database. Update the `src/main/resources/liquibase.yml` configuration with your database connection details.

### Build the Project
Run the following command to build the project, run liquibase migrations and resolve all dependencies:
```
mvn clean install
```

### Access the Application
Once the application is running, access the API documentation generated by Swagger at:
```
http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui.html
```

### Demo: Create, Read, Update, Delete Jobs, and Trigger Scheduler on Quartz
#### Create a New Job
To create a job, send a POST request to /job with the following JSON body:
```
{
  "template": "DUMMY_TEMPLATE_1",
  "remoteIpAddr": "127.9.0.0",
  "startAt": 1745277834000
}
```

#### Read All Existing Job
To retrieve all scheduled jobs, send a GET request to /job/all. This request returns a list of all jobs currently scheduled in the system.

#### Read Existing Job By JobName & JobGroup
To retrieve scheduled jobs by jobName and jobGroup, send a GET request to /job?jobName={jobName}&jobGroup={jobGroup}.

#### Update a Job
To update an existing job in the Quartz Scheduler, you would typically send a PUT request to the endpoint that manages job updates. This request targets the job you want to modify and includes the necessary changes as a JSON payload.
The request body should contain the updated job information you want to apply. Below is an example JSON payload to update a job:
```
{
  "jobName": "DUMMY_TEMPLATE_20250422061329.540",
  "jobGroup": "SimpleJob",
  "startAt": 1745277834000
}
```

#### Delete a Job
To delete an existing job, send a DELETE request to /job?jobName={jobName}&jobGroup={jobGroup}.
![Alt text](asset/swagger-delete.JPG?raw=true "Delete scheduled job")
#### Recurring Jobs
For tasks that require repeated execution, such as those running every 5 minutes, the application utilizes Quartz's powerful scheduling capabilities. Set up cron expressions to define your scheduling needs, making it easy to manage recurring tasks efficiently.
